							<h3 class="description-ted-title">About TED</h3>
							<p class="description-ted-heading">
								TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.
							</p>
							<p class="description-ted-body">
								At a TED conference, the world’s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Phillippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian Greene, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Three major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Vancouver, Canada, simultaneous with TEDActive, in Whistler, BC; and the TEDGlobal Conference takes place each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.
							</p>
							<p class="description-ted-body">
								On TED.com, talks from TED conferences are shared with the world for free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday. Through the Open Translation Project, TED Talks are subtitled by volunteers worldwide into more than 90 languages. Through our distribution networks, TED Talks are shared on TV, radio, Netflix and many websites.

						<h3 class="description-tedx-title">So what is TEDx?</h3>
						<p class="description-tedx-heading">
							In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. </p>
						<p class="description-tedx-body">
							At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

						<h3 class="description-ted-title">FAQ</h3>

						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							Where is the conference?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							The 2014 conference will be taking place at the beautiful  <a href="http://www.vicu.utoronto.ca/hospitality/eventandspace/isabelbader.htm" target="_blank">Isabel Bader Theatre</a>
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							When is the conference taking place?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							TEDxUofT is a full day conference happening on March 1st from 9 am to 6 pm.
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							What can I expect at this conference?
						</p>				
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							This full day conference will be an engaging experience featuring 11 of the University’s brightest talent, in addition to 2 amazing performers. Stay tuned with our <a href="http://facebook.com/tedxuoft" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TEDxUofT" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for announcements regarding our speaker lineup, and our performers! Their ideas will spark discussion during our intermissions, which will feature amazing food and interactive stations that promote the ideals of TED.
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							How can I attend the Conference?
						</p>				
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							Each interested attendee has to first submit an online application. We are looking for passionate delegates who are committed to attending the event, who believe strongly in the power of ideas, and who want to share those ideas with others to make a difference in the world. We will be accepting delegates based on the application alone, so make sure to highlight your best aspects and impress us! 
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							How will I know if my application is accepted?
						</p>				
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							We will be emailing all the accepted delegates once the applications close. There will be two rounds of invitations, so don't fret if you don't hear back right away! Once you accept the invitation, you will be able to purchase a ticket, which you will be given more specific instructions for in the invitation.
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							This conference can’t be free can it? How much does it cost?
						</p>				
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							As of this moment the conference price is expected to be $50. As students we understand just how expensive that is, and how many foot longs that buys you. Our team is working round the clock to round up an even larger selection of sponsors and innovative ideas to reduce the price.  We want to be as transparent as possible with our situation. Delegates from last year will question what has made the ticket price rise so much, and the answer is that this year our team has been ambitious in increasing conference attendance to nearly 500 delegates. As you increase delegates so do the costs; that said you can expect much more than you did last year with amazing food, extraordinary speakers and entertainers that by the end you’ll exit the theatre with a giant smile on your face.
						</p>

						<h3 class="description-tedx-title" style="color:white">_</h3>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							Why do I have to apply?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							TEDx events are usually invitation only and require an application. This is done for a variety of reasons. We have an application form with the goal to learn more about the delegates (like if you are gluten intolerant, but also what you are passionate about), manage the overwhelming interest for the event, and get you out of your comfort zone since you are unlikely to have a friend to tag along. 
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							How will you select delegates?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							This is a tri-campus event, and we want that to be represented in our delegates, but we also want to include alumni, staff, professors and the general public. The application allows us to ensure that everyone who attends is a passionate individual who champions the TED ideals. It also shows us which delegates took the time and effort to thoughtfully fill out our application with something longer than a sentence.
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							Why is this event tri-campus and not just downtown?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							Let’s make something clear - to us the University of Toronto isn’t divided by campuses, we are a sole entity that stands for the same core values that can be amplified and celebrated using the TEDx platform.<br> Our team is pretty much 1/3 UTSC, 1/3 UTSG, and 1/3 UTM, and believe that our divers executive team has made the conference better…but it does make physical in person meetings a nightmare to schedule.
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							I didn't receive an invitation. Are there other ways to be involved with TEDxUofT?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							Yes! This year, we will be having a simultaneous live stream of the event available for anyone who is interested. This will be completely free and accessible through any device -- as long as you have wifi -- and we will post the access link closer to the date. 
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-heading">
							Are you looking for volunteers?
						</p>
						<p class="description-ted-body">
							We are always on the lookout for individuals who are willing to help us out at the Conference. We will be posting more information on our Twitter and Facebook pages closer to the date, so keep your eyes open.

						<h3>Cameron Robertson and Todd Reichert</h3>
						<p>Having been likened to modern day Wright Brothers, Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson are known for the achievement of two historical aviation firsts. In 2010, Todd and Cameron led a team of engineering students to the realization of an ancient aeronautical dream with the first sustained flight of a human-powered flapping-wing aircraft. For this achievement Todd and Cameron were named co-recipients of the CASI Trans-Canada McKee Trophy, among the highest honours in Canadian Aerospace. As a follow on to their first success, the two sought to tackle the 33-year old AHS Sikorsky Prize: a challenge requiring a human-powered helicopter to reach an altitude of 3 metres and stay aloft for 60 seconds. On June 13th 2013, they achieved what many had thought to be impossible, with the prize-winning flight of the Atlas helicopter. </p>

						<h3>Jessie MacAlpine</h3>
						<p>A newspaper article and bioherbicide lead 17-year old Jessie to discover cooking oil could be used to treat malaria.</p>
						<p>Three years ago, Jessie developed an herbicide composed of used coffee grounds and an invasive Canadian weed species. After coming across a newspaper article proposing the potential for herbicides to treat malaria, she realized the active ingredient in her herbicide was naturally found as mustard oil. She approached the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health with her idea and the result was an antimalarial treatment one million times cheaper than its currently available competitors. A single 10mg dose of pure, non-toxic mustard oil delivered orally could significantly inhibit over 94% of infection: a simple, accessible and sustainable alternative to modern antimalarial practices.</p>

						<h3>Andrew Nisker</h3>
						<p>Andrew Nisker makes films that inspire people to take action and revolutionize the way they treat the environment and themselves.</p>
						<p>His latest film, Sticky Situation, takes on the world's second most common form of litter: chewing gum. Andrew believes that the story will act as a gateway to young minds to enhance their awareness of this seemingly invisible pollution that has an enormous social, environmental and economic impact. He is currently working on an accompanying 'gum pollution' app that will give any smart phone user the opportunity to quantify gum pollution by simply taking a picture of the gum-strewn sidewalks in their hometown. He hopes the combination of the film and the crowd-sourced gum pollution map will pressure governments, industry, and consumers to tackle the worldwide polluting habits that perpetuate an annual clean-up cost of over one billion dollars.</p>

						<h3>Sarah Kenvyn</h3>
						<p>Sarah Kenvyn is a generalist. As a singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, web designer, entrepreneur, and science student she juggles many hats. She composed, engineered, produced and mixed her 2010 debut album “This is the Sea” in her home recording studio while starting a carbon neutral web design business and working towards a BSc in neuroscience and cell biology at the University of Toronto.</p>
						<p>Growing up in a rural area without TV and possessing a love of learning, Kenvyn, (aka Sarah Barnett Burns), began her quest for a well-rounded education from a young age. Thanks to a strange and chaotic childhood amidst a community of hippies, Kenvyn learned a diverse set of skills from basket weaving to welding. Since leaving home at 16 to do volunteer work in Zimbabwe she has continued this quest for interdisciplinary learning. She has studied a wide range of subjects from Traditional Chinese Medicine to business management and has worked and volunteered in various fields from environmental activism to graphic design.</p>
						<p>Sarah is the recipient of multiple academic awards including the University of Toronto Excellence Award and the Brookfield Peter Bronfman Leadership Scholarship and plans to attend graduate school next year to conduct research on the epigenetics of early childhood deprivation and brain development. She continues to write and perform music with her band The Craft when she isn’t studying, running her web design business, or pursuing the next challenge.</p>
