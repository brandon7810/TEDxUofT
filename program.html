				<h3>Cameron Robertson &amp; Todd Reichert</h3>
				<h4>Innovation: Taking Time to Fail</h4>
				<h6><i>@camdrobertson</i></h6>
				<p>Having been likened to modern day Wright Brothers, Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson are known for the achievement of two historical aviation firsts. In 2010, Todd and Cameron led a team of engineering students to the realization of an ancient aeronautical dream with the first sustained flight of a human-powered flapping-wing aircraft. For this achievement Todd and Cameron were named co-recipients of the CASI Trans-Canada McKee Trophy, among the highest honours in Canadian Aerospace. As a follow on to their first success, the two sought to tackle the 33-year old AHS Sikorsky Prize: a challenge requiring a human-powered helicopter to reach an altitude of 3 metres and stay aloft for 60 seconds. On June 13th 2013, they achieved what many had thought to be impossible, with the prize-winning flight of the Atlas helicopter.</p>

				<h3>Steve Easterbrook</h3>
				<h4>Computing the Climate: How Can a Computer Model Forecast the Future?</h4>
				<p>Steve Easterbrook studies how models of complex system behaviour can help us to make wise choices about living sustainably on planet earth.</p>
				<p>Steve’s teaching and research focusses on the dynamics of complex systems. He conducted the first detailed anthropological study of how climate scientists build and test computational simulations of the earth’s climate, and is currently investigating how weaknesses in people’s understanding of climate change lead to poor decision-making. In his teaching he uses hands-on simulations to help students develop critical thinking skills to analyze global problems.</p>

				<h3>Marcel Danesi</h3>
				<h4>The Power and Danger of the Kiss</h4>
				<p>Marcel Danesi is professor of anthropology and director of the Program in Semiotics at the University of Toronto. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in recognition of his work in the field of semiotics and communications. He has published extensively on various topics, including the meanings of puzzles in human life. His books have been translated into many languages including Farsi, Russian, Italian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and others. He is currently editor of "Semiotica" the leading journal in the field. He also writes a blog for "Psychology Today" on the relation between puzzles and the brain. In addition to his academic interests, he founded a band with students at the University of Toronto seven years ago at Victoria College, called the Semiotones, which is still playing for charity. All the proceeds from gigs and record sales go to the Hospital for Sick Children. He has composed and written the lyrics for two CDs that are on iTunes. A third CD, titled In My Dreams will be on iTunes shortly.</p>

				<h3>Jessie MacAlpine</h3>
				<h4>The Science Faire Effect: How Youths are Reinventing our World</h4>
				<p>A newspaper article and bioherbicide lead 17-year old Jessie to discover cooking oil could be used to treat malaria.</p>
				<p>Three years ago, Jessie developed an herbicide composed of used coffee grounds and an invasive Canadian weed species. After coming across a newspaper article proposing the potential for herbicides to treat malaria, she realized the active ingredient in her herbicide was naturally found as mustard oil. She approached the McLaughlin-Rotman Centre for Global Health with her idea and the result was an antimalarial treatment one million times cheaper than its currently available competitors. A single 10mg dose of pure, non-toxic mustard oil delivered orally could significantly inhibit over 94% of infection: a simple, accessible and sustainable alternative to modern antimalarial practices.</p>

				<h3>Sarah Kenvyn</h3>
				<h4>In Defense of the Generalist in a Specialists' World</h4>
				<p>Sarah Kenvyn is a generalist. As a singer/songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, web designer, entrepreneur, and science student she juggles many hats. She composed, engineered, produced and mixed her 2010 debut album “This is the Sea” in her home recording studio while starting a carbon neutral web design business and working towards a BSc in neuroscience and cell biology at the University of Toronto.</p>
				<p>Growing up in a rural area without TV and possessing a love of learning, Kenvyn, (aka Sarah Barnett Burns), began her quest for a well-rounded education from a young age. Thanks to a strange and chaotic childhood amidst a community of hippies, Kenvyn learned a diverse set of skills from basket weaving to welding. Since leaving home at 16 to do volunteer work in Zimbabwe she has continued this quest for interdisciplinary learning. She has studied a wide range of subjects from Traditional Chinese Medicine to business management and has worked and volunteered in various fields from environmental activism to graphic design.</p>
				<p>Sarah is the recipient of multiple academic awards including the University of Toronto Excellence Award and the Brookfield Peter Bronfman Leadership Scholarship and plans to attend graduate school next year to conduct research on the epigenetics of early childhood deprivation and brain development. She continues to write and perform music with her band The Craft when she isn’t studying, running her web design business, or pursuing the next challenge.</p>

				<h4>Extreme Manipulation of Electromagnetic Waves with Metamaterials</h4>
				<p>George Eleftheriades is a recognized international authority and pioneer in the new area of metamaterials: Man-made media with electromagnetic properties that transcend those in nature. In 2002 Dr. Eleftheriades introduced a method for synthesizing high-quality metamaterials using loaded transmission lines. Together with his graduate students, he provided the first experimental evidence of imaging beyond the diffraction limit with a negative-index lens and pioneered several novel microwave and optical devices.  These include a recent demonstration of the first experimental thin active cloak.</p>

				<h3>Andrew Nisker</h3>
				<h4>The Dark Side of the Chew</h4>
				<p>Andrew Nisker makes films that inspire people to take action and revolutionize the way they treat the environment and themselves.</p>
				<p>His latest film, Sticky Situation, takes on the world's second most common form of litter: chewing gum. Andrew believes that the story will act as a gateway to young minds to enhance their awareness of this seemingly invisible pollution that has an enormous social, environmental and economic impact. He is currently working on an accompanying 'gum pollution' app that will give any smart phone user the opportunity to quantify gum pollution by simply taking a picture of the gum-strewn sidewalks in their hometown. He hopes the combination of the film and the crowd-sourced gum pollution map will pressure governments, industry, and consumers to tackle the worldwide polluting habits that perpetuate an annual clean-up cost of over one billion dollars.</p>
